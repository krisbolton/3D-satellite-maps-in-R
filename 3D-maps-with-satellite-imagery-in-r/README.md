# Isle of Skye, Scotland, 3D Map in R
The code from a step-by-step tutorial on how to [create 3D maps with satellite imagery in R](https://krisbolton.com/3D-maps-with-satellite-imagery-in-r).

This code was an exploration of Tyler Morgan-Walls 3D, R visualisation library [Rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/). The code follows his [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.tylermw.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-3d-maps-with-satellite-imagery-in-r). I made modifications to render a location of interest to me (the Isle of Skye, Scotland) and to make the tutorial more beginner friendly to people who did not have R, R Studio and various packages installed (see the link on the first line).

See Tyler's blog post (at the end) to create a short video of the rotating landmass you render.
